# 📄 Implementation Report – Are-U-Query-ous

## ✅ Phase 1 – Initial Setup and Configuration

### 🛠️ Setup | 2025-04-14
- Initialized backend and Supabase integration
- Created backend entrypoint (`main.py`) and DB connection logic (`db.py`)
- Configured Dockerfiles and `docker-compose.yml` for environment bootstrapping
- Added placeholder documentation and Supabase credentials template

### 🔐 Config | 2025-04-15
- Created `.env.example` with secure placeholders
- Removed plaintext `supabase-password.txt` file for security compliance

---

## 📦 Phase 2 – Data Pipeline Development

### 📦 Data Pipeline | 2025-04-15
- Created working `.env` and `.env.example` files
- Added real GeoJSON and TopoJSON files for Barcelona and Madrid
- Developed ETL scripts for:
  - `load_districts.py` and `load_neighbourhoods.py` (both cities)
  - Geometry transformation and WKT generation
- Created `upload_to_supabase.py` to automate upload
- Set up `ingest_data.py` to orchestrate ETL + upload

### 🗃️ DB | 2025-04-15
- Designed and implemented PostGIS schema with:
  - `cities`, `districts`, `neighbourhoods`, `indicators`, `point_features`
- Created unified spatial view: `geographical_unit_view`
- Enabled reproducibility by scripting entire schema creation

### 📦 Feature | 2025-04-15
- Finalized `insert_ready_*.json` generation
- Populated test data with `seed.sql`
- Added support for CI/CD-safe testable pipelines

---

## ♻️ Phase 3 – Pipeline Refactor and Robustness

### ♻️ Refactor | 2025-04-15
- Refactored `ingest_data.py` to ensure districts load/upload **before** neighbourhoods
- Split upload stages into `run_district_upload()` and `run_neighbourhood_upload()`
- Removed hardcoded mappings; introduced dynamic Supabase resolution
- Ensured valid foreign key references before upload

### 🗃️ DB | 2025-04-15
- Regenerated all processed JSON exports after refactor
- Synced `schema.sql` with pipeline assumptions

---

## 🧪 Phase 4 – Testing and QA

### 🧪 Test | 2025-04-15
- Created `test_geometry_integrity.py` to validate geometry consistency
- Covered both raw vs. processed checks for all cities (districts + neighbourhoods)
- Added `pytest.ini` to suppress Shapely deprecation warnings
- Ensured test discovery with proper Python path handling

### 🛠️ Setup | 2025-04-15
- Modularized `Makefile` with:
  - `make setup` → DB bootstrapping
  - `make etl` → Run ETL
  - `make test`, `make test_geometry`, `make test_processed`
  - `make clean` → Remove caches and processed files
  - `make all` → Full workflow execution

## 🔜 Upcoming Work
- [ ] Develop backend API endpoints (CA3)
- [ ] Build React/Leaflet dashboard for spatial data exploration
- [ ] Integrate indicator-level data and visual analytics
